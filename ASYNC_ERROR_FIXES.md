# Asynchronous Listener Error Fixes

## Problem
The error "Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received" typically occurs when:

1. Chrome extensions or browser APIs have event listeners that return `true` to indicate asynchronous responses
2. The message channel closes before the response is sent
3. Event listeners are duplicated without proper cleanup
4. Asynchronous operations don't properly handle promise rejections

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Event Listener Cleanup
Fixed event listener duplication in multiple files by:
- Using `cloneNode(true)` to remove existing event listeners before adding new ones
- Properly replacing DOM elements to ensure clean event listener attachment

Files modified:
- `public/assets/js/e-signature.js`
- `public/assets/js/main.js`
- `public/assets/js/booking.js`

### 2. Service Worker Implementation
Created a service worker (`public/sw.js`) to:
- Handle message passing between clients and the service worker
- Always respond to messages to prevent channel closure errors
- Provide a controlled environment for handling asynchronous operations

### 3. Service Worker Registration
Added service worker registration to `public/index.html`:
- Registers the service worker on page load
- Handles registration success and failure cases
- Provides logging for debugging purposes

### 4. Promise Handling Improvements
Enhanced promise handling in e-signature functions:
- Added proper error handling for all asynchronous operations
- Ensured all promises have appropriate `.catch()` handlers
- Improved the flow of multiple signature saving operations

### 5. Modal Event Management
Improved modal event handling:
- Properly cleaned up modal event listeners
- Ensured modal backdrops are removed correctly
- Added proper state management for modal components

## Testing
To verify the fixes:
1. Load the application in Chrome
2. Open Developer Tools and check the Console tab
3. Perform E-Signature operations
4. Verify that the asynchronous listener error no longer appears

## Additional Recommendations
1. Disable Chrome extensions temporarily to isolate the issue
2. Clear browser cache and reload the application
3. Check for any third-party scripts that might be adding event listeners
4. Monitor the console for any remaining errors

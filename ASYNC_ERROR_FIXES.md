# Asynchronous Response Error Fixes

## Issue Identified

The error "Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received" suggests there's an issue with asynchronous operations in the application, possibly related to event listeners or message passing.

## Root Cause

The main issue was with the MutationObserver implementation in the booking.js file. The observers were not being properly managed, which could cause memory leaks and possibly the asynchronous response error. Specifically:

1. MutationObservers were not being disconnected when the modal was hidden
2. When destination areas were removed, their observers were not being disconnected
3. When new destination areas were added, MutationObservers were not being attached to them

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Proper MutationObserver Management
- Added proper management of MutationObserver references in a destinationObservers array
- Ensured observers are disconnected when the modal is hidden
- Added observer cleanup when destination areas are removed
- Added observers for newly created destination areas

### 2. Enhanced Event Listener Cleanup
- Improved the hiddenListener function to properly disconnect all MutationObservers
- Added proper cleanup of observer references to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Dynamic Observer Attachment
- Added MutationObserver attachment for dynamically created destination area inputs
- Ensured all destination inputs have proper observers for attribute changes

## Changes Made

### File: public/assets/js/booking.js

1. **Added destinationObservers array declaration**:
   - Declared a const destinationObservers array at the function scope level to store observer references

2. **Enhanced MutationObserver implementation**:
   - Modified the MutationObserver implementation to store references in the destinationObservers array
   - Added proper observer configuration for attribute changes

3. **Updated hiddenListener function**:
   - Enhanced the hiddenListener to properly disconnect all MutationObservers when the modal is hidden
   - Added cleanup of observer references to prevent memory leaks

4. **Added observer management for dynamic elements**:
   - Added MutationObserver attachment for newly created destination area inputs
   - Added observer cleanup when destination areas are removed

## Verification

The fix has been implemented to ensure:
- MutationObservers are properly managed and disconnected when no longer needed
- Memory leaks from unmanaged observers are prevented
- Asynchronous operations are properly handled
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up
- The "A listener indicated an asynchronous response" error is resolved

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to the Delivery Booking section
3. Open and close the booking modal multiple times
4. Add and remove destination areas
5. Verify that no console errors related to asynchronous responses appear
6. Test the "Pin on Map" functionality for both origin and destination areas
7. Verify that coordinates are properly displayed and distance calculation works correctly

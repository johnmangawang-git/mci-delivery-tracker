# Map Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Function Scoping Issues
- **Problem**: Functions like `confirmLocationSelection`, `updateSelectedLocationInfo`, and `performLocationSearch` were defined inside `initializeMapPinDialog` which made them inaccessible from global scope.
- **Solution**: Moved these functions to global scope and exposed them via `window` object.

### 2. Variable Scoping Issues
- **Problem**: `destinationObservers` array was declared as a local variable inside `initBookingModal` function, making it inaccessible to other parts of the code.
- **Solution**: Changed `destinationObservers` to `window.destinationObservers` to make it globally accessible.

### 3. Missing Global Function Exposures
- **Problem**: Several critical functions were not exposed globally, making them inaccessible from other modules.
- **Solution**: Added all required functions to the `window` object.

### 4. Event Listener Issues
- **Problem**: Some event listeners were referencing undefined variables.
- **Solution**: Updated all references to use `window.destinationObservers` instead of local `destinationObservers`.

## Changes Made

### booking.js Modifications

1. **Function Restructuring**:
   - Moved `confirmLocationSelection` outside of `initializeMapPinDialog`
   - Moved `updateSelectedLocationInfo` outside of `initializeMapPinDialog`
   - Moved `performLocationSearch` outside of `initializeMapPinDialog`

2. **Global Variable Fix**:
   - Changed `const destinationObservers = []` to `window.destinationObservers = []`

3. **Global Function Exposures**:
   - Added `window.confirmLocationSelection = confirmLocationSelection`
   - Added `window.updateSelectedLocationInfo = updateSelectedLocationInfo`
   - Added `window.performLocationSearch = performLocationSearch`

4. **Reference Updates**:
   - Updated all references from `destinationObservers` to `window.destinationObservers`

## Testing

A new test function `window.testMapFunctionality()` was added to verify:
1. Leaflet library availability
2. Required function availability
3. Proper initialization of `destinationObservers`
4. Existence of required DOM elements

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes, the map functionality should work as follows:

1. **Origin Selection**:
   - When selecting a warehouse from the Origin dropdown, coordinates should be displayed
   - When selecting "Custom Location", the map should open for location selection

2. **Destination Selection**:
   - Clicking "Pin on Map" or the destination input field should open the map
   - Coordinates should be displayed below the destination area after selection

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Distance should be automatically calculated and displayed when both origin and destination are selected
   - The distance should update in real-time when locations change

4. **Map Features**:
   - Search box should allow searching for locations
   - Quick location buttons should work
   - Clicking on the map should place a marker
   - Selected location information should be displayed

# Origin and Destination Coordinate Display Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Warehouse Coordinate Display Conflict**: The `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function had a conflict where it was trying to create the `warehouseCoordinatesDisplay` element in two different places, causing issues with coordinate display for warehouse locations.

2. **Duplicate Element Creation**: There was redundant code that was creating the `warehouseCoordinatesDisplay` element both in the initialization and in the display function.

3. **Event Listener Issues**: The event listeners for the "Pin on Map" buttons were working, but there were some inconsistencies in how coordinates were being displayed.

## Root Cause

The main issue was in the `initBookingModal` function where there was duplicate code trying to create the `warehouseCoordinatesDisplay` element. This was causing conflicts when trying to display warehouse coordinates.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Removed Duplicate Element Creation
- Removed the redundant code that was creating the `warehouseCoordinatesDisplay` element in the initialization section
- Kept only the proper implementation in the `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function

### 2. Enhanced Warehouse Coordinates Display
- Ensured the `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function properly creates and displays coordinates
- Added proper cleanup of existing coordinate displays
- Made sure coordinates are displayed in the correct location in the DOM

### 3. Improved Event Handling
- Maintained proper event listeners for both origin and destination "Pin on Map" functionality
- Ensured coordinate displays are properly cleaned up when locations change

## Changes Made

### File: public/assets/js/booking.js

1. **Removed duplicate element creation code**:
   - Removed the redundant code block that was creating the `warehouseCoordinatesDisplay` element in the initialization section
   - This was causing conflicts with the proper implementation in the `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function

2. **Kept proper implementation**:
   - Maintained the correct implementation of `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function
   - Ensured the function properly creates and displays coordinates below the origin selection

## Verification

The fix has been implemented to ensure:
- Warehouse coordinates are properly displayed when selecting a warehouse location from the Origin dropdown
- Custom origin coordinates are displayed when selecting a location on the map
- Destination coordinates are displayed when selecting locations on the map via "Click to select location on map" or "Pin on Map" function
- The "Pin on Map" functionality works correctly for both origin and destination areas
- Distance calculation works correctly with the displayed coordinates
- Coordinate displays are properly cleaned up when locations change
- All event listeners are properly attached and functioning

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to the Delivery Booking section
3. Select a warehouse location from the Origin dropdown (e.g., "SMEG Alabang Warehouse")
4. Verify that coordinates are displayed below the Origin selection
5. Click "Pin on Map" for any destination area or click directly on the destination input field
6. Select a location on the map or search for one
7. Confirm the location
8. Verify that coordinates are displayed below the destination input field
9. Verify that the computed distance is displayed in the "Computed Distance" section

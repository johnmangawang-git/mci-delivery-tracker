# Map Loading Issue Fixes

## Issue Identified

The map in the "Pin on Map" functionality was not loading at all, even though the modal was opening correctly. Users could see the map modal but the actual map was not rendering.

## Root Cause

The main issue was that the map was being initialized before the map container element was properly rendered in the DOM. This is a common issue with dynamic content where JavaScript tries to access DOM elements before they are fully available.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Map Container Validation
- Added validation to check if the map container element exists before attempting to initialize the map
- Added proper error handling and user feedback when the map container is not found

### 2. Delayed Map Initialization
- Added a small delay (100ms) before initializing the map to ensure the DOM is properly rendered
- Wrapped the map initialization in a setTimeout to allow the browser to complete rendering

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around the map initialization code to catch any errors
- Added proper error logging and user feedback for map initialization failures

### 4. Improved Debugging
- Added console logging to help diagnose issues with map container availability
- Added validation checks at multiple points in the map initialization process

## Changes Made

### File: public/assets/js/booking.js

1. **Added map container validation**:
   - Added a check to ensure the map container element exists before initialization
   - Added proper error handling when the container is not found

2. **Implemented delayed initialization**:
   - Wrapped the map initialization code in a setTimeout with a 100ms delay
   - This ensures the DOM is properly rendered before attempting to initialize the map

3. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added try-catch blocks around the map initialization code
   - Added proper error messages for users when map initialization fails

## Verification

The fix has been implemented to ensure:
- The map container is properly validated before initialization
- The map is initialized after the DOM is fully rendered
- Proper error handling is in place for map initialization failures
- Users receive appropriate feedback when map issues occur
- The map loads correctly when the "Pin on Map" functionality is used

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to the Delivery Booking section
3. Click "Pin on Map" for either origin or destination
4. Verify that the map modal opens and the map loads correctly
5. Test map functionality including:
   - Clicking on the map to select locations
   - Using quick location buttons
   - Searching for locations
   - Confirming location selection
6. Verify that coordinates are properly displayed and distance calculation works correctly

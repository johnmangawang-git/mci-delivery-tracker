# Pin on Map Functionality Fixes

## Issue Identified

The "Pin on Map" functionality for both origin and destination areas was not working due to a scoping issue where functions were being exposed globally before they were defined, causing undefined function errors.

## Root Cause

In the booking.js file, the global exposure of functions was happening at the beginning of the file before the functions were actually defined. This caused the following issues:

1. `displayDestinationCoordinates`, `displayOriginCoordinates`, `hideDestinationCoordinates`, `updateDistance`, and `showMapPinDialog` were being attached to the window object before they were defined
2. This resulted in `undefined` values being assigned to these window properties
3. When the "Pin on Map" buttons were clicked, the functions were not available, causing the functionality to fail silently

## Fix Implemented

1. **Removed premature global exposure**: Removed the early global exposure of functions from the beginning of the file

2. **Added proper global exposure**: Moved the global exposure of all required functions to the end of the file, after all functions are properly defined

3. **Maintained proper function definitions**: Ensured all functions remain properly defined in their correct locations

## Changes Made

### File: public/assets/js/booking.js

1. Removed the following lines from the beginning of the file:
   ```javascript
   // Make sure all required functions are globally available
   window.displayDestinationCoordinates = displayDestinationCoordinates;
   window.displayOriginCoordinates = displayOriginCoordinates;
   window.hideDestinationCoordinates = hideDestinationCoordinates;
   window.updateDistance = updateDistance;
   window.showMapPinDialog = showMapPinDialog;
   ```

2. Added the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```javascript
   // Make sure all required functions are globally available
   window.displayDestinationCoordinates = displayDestinationCoordinates;
   window.displayOriginCoordinates = displayOriginCoordinates;
   window.hideDestinationCoordinates = hideDestinationCoordinates;
   window.updateDistance = updateDistance;
   window.showMapPinDialog = showMapPinDialog;
   window.initBookingModal = initBookingModal;
   ```

## Verification

The fix has been tested and verified to ensure:
- Map modals open correctly for both origin and destination locations when "Pin on Map" buttons are clicked
- Coordinates are properly displayed below both origin and destination input fields
- Distance calculation works correctly with the displayed coordinates
- All event listeners are properly attached and functioning
- Functions are globally accessible as needed

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to the Delivery Booking section
3. Click "Pin on Map" for origin or any destination area
4. Select a location on the map or search for one
5. Confirm the location
6. Verify that coordinates are displayed below the respective input field
7. Verify that the distance is calculated and displayed correctly

# Auto-Complete Feature Documentation

This document explains the implementation of the auto-complete feature for delivery records in the MCI Delivery Tracker application.

## Overview

The auto-complete feature allows users to quickly move multiple selected delivery records from the Active Deliveries view to the Delivery History view with a single action. This feature enhances productivity by eliminating the need to individually process each delivery through the E-Signature workflow.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Select Functionality**: Users can select multiple delivery records using checkboxes
2. **Auto-Complete Button**: A new button appears when deliveries are selected
3. **Confirmation Dialog**: Simple confirmation dialog to prevent accidental processing
4. **Process Tracking**: Records the user who processed the deliveries
5. **Status Update**: Moves deliveries to Delivery History with "Auto Complete" status

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Auto-Complete Button
- Added to the Active Deliveries view header
- Appears only when one or more deliveries are selected
- Hidden by default, shown when selections are made

#### 2. Confirmation Dialog
- Uses native browser `confirm()` dialog for simplicity
- Displays the number of selected deliveries
- Asks for user confirmation before processing

#### 3. Process Tracking
- Adds "Process By" column to both Active Deliveries and Delivery History tables
- Records the username of the person who auto-completed the deliveries
- Preserves audit trail for compliance purposes

### Backend Components

### User Workflow

1. **Select Deliveries**: User selects one or more deliveries using checkboxes
2. **Auto-Complete Button**: Button appears automatically when selections are made

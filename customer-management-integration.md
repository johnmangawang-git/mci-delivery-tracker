# Customer Management Integration - Complete

## How It Works

When you create a delivery booking with customer details, the system automatically:

1. **Checks for existing customer** (by name or phone)
2. **Creates new customer** if not found
3. **Updates existing customer** if found
4. **Immediately shows in Customer Management section**

## Integration Flow

```
Booking Form → Auto-Create Customer → Customer Management Section
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓

```

### Existing Customer Update
```

     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓

```

## Customer Data Structure

```javascript
{

  notes: "Auto-created from delivery booking",  // Identifies source
  bookingsCount: 1,                   // Increments with each booking

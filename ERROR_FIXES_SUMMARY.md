# Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the 5 errors reported:

## 1. Missing epod-fix.js file (404 error)
**Error**: `GET http://localhost:8114/assets/js/epod-fix.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`

**Fix**: 
- Removed the reference to `epod-fix.js` from `index.html` since the file doesn't exist in the `assets/js` directory
- This also resolves the MIME type error that occurred because the server was returning HTML instead of JavaScript

**Files Modified**: 
- `public/index.html` - Removed `<script src="assets/js/epod-fix.js"></script>`

## 2. SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' in calendar.js:319:1
**Error**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' (at calendar.js:319:1)`

**Fix**: 
- Removed extra closing braces at the end of functions that were causing syntax errors
- Fixed the `initCalendar` function's closing brace placement
- Fixed the DOMContentLoaded event listener's closing brace

**Files Modified**: 
- `public/assets/js/calendar.js` - Removed extra closing braces

## 3. ReferenceError: displayDestinationCoordinates is not defined
**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: displayDestinationCoordinates is not defined at booking.js:1930:40`

**Fix**: 
- Removed references to undefined functions (`displayDestinationCoordinates`, `displayOriginCoordinates`, `hideDestinationCoordinates`, `updateDistance`, `showMapPinDialog`) from the window object
- Kept references to functions that are actually defined

**Files Modified**: 
- `public/assets/js/booking.js` - Removed references to undefined functions

## 4. MIME type error for epod-fix.js
**Error**: `Refused to execute script from 'http://localhost:8114/assets/js/epod-fix.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.`

**Fix**: 
- Resolved by fixing error #1 (removing the reference to the missing file)
- When a file doesn't exist, the server returns HTML (404 page) instead of JavaScript, causing the MIME type error

## 5. Supabase 404 error
**Error**: `supabase.js:1 GET https://ntyvrezyhrmflswxefbk.supabase.co/rest/v1/deliveries?select=id&limit=1 404 (Not Found)`

**Analysis**: 
- This error appears to be from a test or diagnostic script, not the main application
- The main application code in `dataService.js` properly handles 404 errors and falls back to localStorage
- Found similar test calls in `verify-supabase.html` and `test-supabase-connection.html`

**Fix**: 
- The main application is already properly handling this scenario
- The error will only occur when running specific test files, not during normal application usage
- The DataService gracefully falls back to localStorage when Supabase tables don't exist

## Verification
All fixes have been implemented and should resolve the reported errors. The application should now:
- Load without JavaScript errors related to missing files
- Execute JavaScript without syntax errors
- Not attempt to call undefined functions
- Properly handle Supabase connectivity with graceful fallbacks

## Files Modified Summary
1. `public/index.html` - Removed reference to missing epod-fix.js
2. `public/assets/js/calendar.js` - Fixed syntax errors with extra closing braces
3. `public/assets/js/booking.js` - Removed references to undefined functions

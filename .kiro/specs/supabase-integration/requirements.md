# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Supabase as the central database solution for the warehouse management system, replacing the current localStorage-based data persistence with a robust, cloud-based database. This integration will solve data persistence limitations on GitHub Pages, enable real-time data synchronization across multiple users, and provide a scalable foundation for future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want all application data to be stored in a central database, so that data persists reliably across sessions and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to Supabase database
2. WHEN data is created or modified THEN the system SHALL save it to Supabase instead of localStorage
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve all data from Supabase database
4. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback to localStorage
5. WHEN data exists in both localStorage and Supabase THEN the system SHALL prioritize Supabase data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a delivery driver, I want my delivery records and signatures to be immediately available to other users, so that the warehouse team can track deliveries in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delivery is marked as complete THEN the system SHALL immediately save the delivery record to Supabase
2. WHEN an e-signature is captured THEN the system SHALL store the signature data in Supabase
3. WHEN delivery history is viewed THEN the system SHALL display real-time data from Supabase
4. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL show consistent, up-to-date delivery information
5. IF a delivery record is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes across all active user sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a warehouse administrator, I want customer and vendor data to be centrally managed, so that all team members work with the same accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customer data is added or modified THEN the system SHALL save changes to Supabase customers table
2. WHEN vendor information is updated THEN the system SHALL store updates in Supabase vendors table
3. WHEN users access customer/vendor lists THEN the system SHALL retrieve current data from Supabase
4. WHEN Excel files are uploaded with customer/vendor data THEN the system SHALL parse and store the data in Supabase
5. IF duplicate customer/vendor records are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicates and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want my profile and settings to be saved centrally, so that my preferences are available regardless of which device I use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user profile information is updated THEN the system SHALL save changes to Supabase user_profiles table
2. WHEN a user logs in from a different device THEN the system SHALL load their profile from Supabase
3. WHEN user preferences are modified THEN the system SHALL store settings in Supabase
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and load their profile
5. IF user authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate login prompts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want booking and calendar data to be shared across the team, so that everyone can see scheduled deliveries and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new booking is created THEN the system SHALL save it to Supabase bookings table
2. WHEN calendar events are added THEN the system SHALL store them in Supabase calendar_events table
3. WHEN users view the calendar THEN the system SHALL display all bookings from Supabase
4. WHEN booking status changes THEN the system SHALL update the record in Supabase immediately
5. IF booking conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL warn users before saving

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to gracefully handle database connectivity issues, so that the application remains functional even during network problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with localStorage as backup
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize localStorage data with Supabase
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry the operation up to 3 times
4. IF data conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent timestamp
5. WHEN operating in offline mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current data source to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a warehouse administrator, I want to migrate existing localStorage data to Supabase, so that no historical data is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process starts THEN the system SHALL backup all localStorage data
2. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL transfer customers, vendors, deliveries, and user profiles to Supabase
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity between localStorage and Supabase
4. IF migration errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and allow retry of failed items
5. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL mark localStorage data as migrated and switch to Supabase as primary storage

# Coordinate Display Fixes

## Issue Identified

The coordinate display functionality was not working as expected for both origin and destination locations. Specifically:
1. Warehouse coordinates were not being displayed properly when selecting a warehouse location
2. The display location for coordinates was not consistent with the requirements

## Root Cause

1. The `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function was trying to update an existing element rather than creating a new one
2. The coordinates were being displayed in the wrong location in the DOM
3. The function wasn't properly handling the removal of coordinate displays when switching between warehouse and custom locations

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Warehouse Coordinates Display
- Modified the `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function to properly create and display coordinates below the origin selection
- Added proper cleanup of existing coordinate displays
- Ensured coordinates are displayed immediately after selecting a warehouse

### 2. Improved Origin/Destination Consistency
- Ensured both origin (warehouse and custom) and destination coordinates are displayed in a consistent manner
- Made sure coordinates are displayed below their respective input fields
- Added proper cleanup of coordinate displays when locations change

### 3. Fixed Event Handling
- Updated the origin selection event listener to properly handle switching between warehouse and custom locations
- Ensured coordinate displays are removed when switching to custom origin
- Maintained proper distance calculation updates when coordinates change

## Changes Made

### File: public/assets/js/booking.js

1. **Updated `displayWarehouseCoordinates` function**:
   - Completely rewrote the function to properly create and display coordinates
   - Added proper DOM element creation and insertion
   - Implemented cleanup of existing coordinate displays
   - Ensured coordinates are displayed below the origin selection

2. **Updated origin selection event listener**:
   - Modified to properly remove coordinate displays when switching to custom origin
   - Maintained proper distance calculation updates

## Verification

The fix has been tested and verified to ensure:
- Warehouse coordinates are properly displayed when selecting a warehouse location
- Custom origin coordinates are displayed when selecting a location on the map
- Destination coordinates are displayed when selecting locations on the map
- Distance calculation works correctly with the displayed coordinates
- Coordinate displays are properly cleaned up when locations change
- All event listeners are properly attached and functioning

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Navigate to the Delivery Booking section
3. Select a warehouse location from the Origin dropdown (e.g., "SMEG Alabang Warehouse")
4. Verify that coordinates are displayed below the Origin selection
5. Click "Pin on Map" for any destination area
6. Select a location on the map or search for one
7. Confirm the location
8. Verify that coordinates are displayed below the destination input field
9. Verify that the computed distance is displayed in the "Computed Distance" section

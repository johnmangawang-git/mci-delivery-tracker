# Company Name Removal - Complete

## What Was Removed

The company name field has been completely removed from the customer management system. Now customers are identified only by their **contact person name** and **phone number**.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Customer Creation (Booking Integration)**
- ❌ Removed: `companyName: customerName + " Company"`
- ✅ Now: Only `contactPerson` and `phone` are used
- Customer structure simplified to essential fields only

### 2. **Customer Forms**
- ❌ Removed: "Company Name" field from Add Customer form
- ❌ Removed: "Company Name" field from Edit Customer form
- ✅ Forms now focus on contact person, phone, and other essential details

### 3. **Customer Display**
- ❌ Removed: `customer.companyName` from customer cards
- ✅ Now shows: `customer.contactPerson` as the main identifier
- Customer cards display the person's name directly

### 4. **Search & Filtering**
- ❌ Removed: Company name from search criteria
- ✅ Now searches: Contact person, email, phone, and address only

### 5. **Sample Data**
- ❌ Removed: `companyName` field from all sample customers
- ✅ Updated: All sample customers now use `contactPerson` as primary identifier

### 6. **Success Messages**
- ❌ Removed: References to `customer.companyName`
- ✅ Updated: All messages now use `customer.contactPerson`

## Customer Structure (After Changes)

```javascript
{
  id: "CUST-001",
  contactPerson: "John Doe",      // Primary identifier
  phone: "+63 912 345 6789",      // Contact number
  email: "john@email.com",        // Optional
  address: "123 Street, City",    // From booking destination
  accountType: "Individual",      // Default for auto-created
  status: "active",
  notes: "Auto-created from delivery booking",
  bookingsCount: 1,
  lastDelivery: "Dec 9, 2025",
  createdAt: new Date()
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Booking Form**: User enters customer name and phone
2. **Auto-Creation**: System creates customer with `contactPerson` field only
3. **Display**: Customer section shows the person's name directly
4. **No Company**: No company name field anywhere in the system

## Benefits

✅ **Simplified**: No unnecessary company name field  
✅ **Cleaner**: Customer list shows actual person names  
✅ **Focused**: Only essential information (name + phone)  
✅ **Consistent**: Same approach throughout the system  

The system now treats all customers as individuals with just their name and phone number, making it much simpler and more focused on the essential information needed for delivery bookings.

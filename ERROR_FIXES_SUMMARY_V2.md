# Error Fixes Summary V2

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the 3 errors reported:

## 1. Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input (at calendar.js:2199:1)
**Error**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input (at calendar.js:2199:1)`

**Fix**: 
- Added missing closing brace at the end of the file
- The file was missing a newline at the end which caused the "Unexpected end of input" error

**Files Modified**: 
- `public/assets/js/calendar.js` - Added missing closing brace and newline

## 2. Supabase 404 error
**Error**: `supabase.js:1 GET https://ntyvrezyhrmflswxefbk.supabase.co/rest/v1/deliveries?select=id&limit=1 404 (Not Found)`

**Analysis**: 
- This error occurs when the DataService checks if Supabase tables exist
- The application properly handles this scenario by falling back to localStorage
- This is expected behavior when the Supabase database tables haven't been created yet
- The error does not affect application functionality

**Fix**: 
- Confirmed that the application properly handles this error with graceful fallbacks
- No code changes needed as the error handling is already implemented correctly

## 3. Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
**Error**: `Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received`

**Analysis**: 
- This error is related to the service worker message handling
- Occurs when the service worker tries to respond to a message but the channel has already closed

**Fix**: 
- Added a check to ensure the message port exists before trying to respond
- This prevents the error from occurring when the message channel is closed

**Files Modified**: 
- `public/sw.js` - Added check for message port before responding

## Verification
All fixes have been implemented and should resolve the reported errors. The application should now:
- Load without JavaScript syntax errors
- Properly handle Supabase connectivity with graceful fallbacks
- Not show message channel errors from the service worker

## Files Modified Summary
1. `public/assets/js/calendar.js` - Fixed syntax error with missing closing brace
2. `public/sw.js` - Fixed service worker message handling to prevent channel closed errors

## Additional Notes
- The Supabase 404 error is expected behavior and does not indicate a problem with the application
- The application correctly falls back to localStorage when Supabase tables don't exist
- All core functionality should work regardless of Supabase connectivity status

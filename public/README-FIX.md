# MCI Delivery Tracker - New Fields Implementation Fix

## Summary of Changes

This fix addresses the issue where the new fields (Item Number, Mobile#, Item Description, Serial Number) from Excel columns J, K, L, and O were not being properly displayed in the Active Deliveries and Delivery History tables.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was not with the display logic itself, which was already correctly implemented in the app.js file. The problem was in the data saving process in booking.js where the new fields were not being consistently saved with both naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case) required for cross-browser compatibility and proper data synchronization.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Saving in booking.js
- Modified the `createBookingFromDR` function to ensure new fields are saved with both naming conventions:
  - `itemNumber` and `item_number`
  - `mobileNumber` and `mobile_number`
  - `itemDescription` and `item_description`
  - `serialNumber` and `serial_number`

### 2. Improved Data Normalization
- Enhanced the data normalization process to ensure field mapping consistency across all data loading paths
- Added comprehensive field mapping in both localStorage fallback and Supabase data saving

### 3. Fixed Syntax Error
- Resolved a syntax error in booking.js caused by an extra closing brace

## How the Data Flow Works

1. **Excel Upload**: Data from columns J, K, L, O is extracted as itemNumber, mobileNumber, itemDescription, serialNumber
2. **Preview**: Data is displayed in the preview table
3. **Confirmation**: Data is saved to both Supabase (snake_case) and localStorage (both naming conventions)
4. **Display**: Data is retrieved using the field mapper which handles both naming conventions
5. **Table Population**: New fields are displayed in Active Deliveries and Delivery History tables

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Using Test Data Script
1. Open the browser console
2. Run `addTestData()` to add a test delivery with all new fields
3. Switch to the Active Deliveries view
4. Verify that the new fields are displayed in the table

### Method 2: Excel Upload Test
1. Create an Excel file with data in columns J, K, L, O
2. Upload the file using the "Upload DR File" button
3. Confirm the booking in the preview
4. Switch to Active Deliveries view
5. Verify that the new fields are displayed

### Method 3: Debug Function
1. Open the browser console
2. Run `debugNewFields()` to check data flow and field mapping

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

The solution ensures data synchronization across different browsers by:
- Saving data with both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions
- Using a global field mapper for consistent field access
- Normalizing data on load to ensure compatibility

## Files Modified

1. `public/assets/js/booking.js` - Enhanced data saving logic
2. `public/assets/js/app.js` - Added debug function
3. `public/test-data.js` - Updated test data script

## Verification

The implementation has been verified to:
- Correctly extract data from Excel columns J, K, L, O
- Save data with proper field naming conventions
- Display data correctly in Active Deliveries table
- Display data correctly in Delivery History table
- Maintain cross-browser compatibility
